# xhr
XMLHttpRequest for the Matrix (dataflow library)

So far we just have [the CLJS version](https://github.com/kennytilton/xhr/blob/master/cljs/xhr/README.md) but it is pretty trivial so if you would like the JS version just create an issue (or take a crack at it yourself!).

btw, this is bare bones proof-of-concept implementation. Again, if more options are needed on requests just file an issue.
