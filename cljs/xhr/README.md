# xhr

A Clojure/Clojurescript library providing [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix)-aware XMLHttpRequests.

## Clojars
> [tiltontec/xhr "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

## Usage

For now, please see the tests, and even then it is a proof-of-concept slapdash glimpse of what will be after we start using the capability in anger.

Or you might glean a little from [my amusing first experiences](https://github.com/kennytilton/xhr/blob/master/cljs/xhr/XHR.md) lifting XHRs into the Matrix.
